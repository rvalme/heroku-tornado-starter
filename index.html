        Hello User :-)

        <p>Techniques used include HTTP header fingerprinting using Javascript userAgent information. Also font fingerprinting using lalit patel's javascript font detector. </br> I also used plugin detection seeing what plugins the browser has installed and fingerprinting the browser that way. I used a python backend to store these fingerprinting metrics on the server side in a json file. Other methods were explored but were left out, for example checking screen
        resolution.</br>
        However, on my VM screen resolution changed when resized, even though the same browser was in use. As well screen resolution changed when I used my second monitor in my dual monitor setup. If more metrics that properly reflected the goal of browser fingerprinting, were added fingerprint tracking could have been even more comprehensive.</p>
